Airflow as a basement in what is called Direct Acyclic Graph, what basically mean,
it contains graths with direct connected edges and does not contain any loop or cycles hence the term Acyclic.

The acyclic is a very important part, given that it prevents us from running into circular dependecies between tasks.

Executing a pipeline

1. For each open (= uncompleted) task in the graph, do the following:
    1.1 For each edge pointing, check if the “upstream” task on the other end of the edge has been completed.
    1.2 If all upstream tasks have been completed, add the task under consideration to a queue of tasks to be executed.
2. Execute the tasks in the execution queue, marking them completed once they finish performing their work.
3. Jump back to step 1 and repeat until all tasks in the graph have been completed.
